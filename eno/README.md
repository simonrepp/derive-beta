# eno

eno notation.

## File extension

`.eno`

## MIME Type

`text/eno`


## Website

Proposed: `meet-eno.org`

## Design principles

> the whole idea with ignoring whitespace at the begin, end, between different connected lines and between relevant tokens is:
> when you write on paper you don't care if something is "a little to the right, left, further down or whatever"
> as long as "words" or whatever you write on paper are clearly separated and graspable by their intent,
> everything is fine! So this is how eno should behave as well because this caters to all audiences

## Libraries

Proposal: Prefer to drop the js/rb/py/rs appendices.
Just handy for local development right now.
