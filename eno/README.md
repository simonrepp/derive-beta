# eno

## Name contenders!

- elementary notation (.eno)
- plain (.plain)

## File extension

First candidate proposal: `.adv`

> Why .adv ?
> It has the most apparent likelihood with "adventure"
> It's short and elegant
> Also looks abit like "advance" or "advantage"

Second candidate proposal: `.atxt`

> Why .atxt ?
> It closely associates with .txt - which it should! - thereby
> also communicating the notion that this is "just a textfile"
> to less tech savy audiences, for which the idea that any
> file is really just a file with an arbitrary extension is
> often foreign, because they strongly associate files with
> dedicated programs who are only able to create/modify files.
> (except for .txt, for which - curiously - these mental rules
> are often not applied, or less so anyhow)

## MIME Type

`text/adventure`
`text/eno`


## Website

Proposed: `tryadventure.org`
Other candidates: `textslashadventure.org`

## Design principles

> the whole idea with ignoring whitespace at the begin, end, between different connected lines and between relevant tokens is:
> when you write on paper you don't care if something is "a little to the right, left, further down or whatever"
> as long as "words" or whatever you write on paper are clearly separated and graspable by their intent,
> everything is fine! So this is how plain should behave as well because this caters to all audiences

## Libraries

Proposal: Prefer to drop the js/rb/py/rs appendices.
Just handy for local development right now.
