# text/adventure

## File extension

First candidate proposal: `.atxt`

> Why .atxt ?
> It closely associates with .txt - which it should! - thereby
> also communicating the notion that this is "just a textfile"
> to less tech savy audiences, for which the idea that any
> file is really just a file with an arbitrary extension is
> often foreign, because they strongly associate files with
> dedicated programs who are only able to create/modify files.
> (except for .txt, for which - curiously - these mental rules
> are often not applied, or less so anyhow)

Second candidate proposal: `.adv`

> Why .adv ?
> It has the most apparent likelihood with "adventure"
